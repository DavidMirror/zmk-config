My zmk-config for my Draculad (one-of-a-kind XIAO ble version courtesy of [teadetime](https://github.com/teadetime/zmk-config/tree/main/config/boards/shields/drac)), and Dilemma 3x5\_2 (thanks to [0xcharly](https://github.com/0xcharly/zmk-config/tree/master/config/boards/shields/dilemma))


I'm using urob's [zmk](https://github.com/urob/zmk) and [zmk-nodefree-config](https://github.com/urob/zmk-nodefree-config), and I'm also attempting to replicate the structure of urob's [zmk-config](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config) to keep configurations across the two boards consistent.
