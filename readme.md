zmk-config for my Draculad (one-of-a-kind XIAO ble version courtesy of [teadetime](https://github.com/teadetime/zmk-config/tree/main/config/boards/shields/drac)) and Dilemma 3x5\_2 (thanks to [0xcharly](https://github.com/0xcharly/zmk-config/tree/master/config/boards/shields/dilemma))

I'm using urob's [zmk](https://github.com/urob/zmk) and [zmk-nodefree-config](https://github.com/urob/zmk-nodefree-config), and I'm also attempting to replicate the structure of urob's [zmk-config](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config) to keep configurations across the two boards consistent.


Update Apr 12 2024, my Dilemma is wired and I've learned that ZMK does not currently support wired splits. Without wanting to get new microcontrollers, I've decided to either wait this out or pivot to a Sugar Glider or Reviung 41. Currently following [lesshonor's Mechhwild ZMK work](https://github.com/lesshonor/mechwild-zmk-keyboards/tree/cirque) and [PR 1117 of ZMK](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/1117)
